# Description

This is a modest and simple DPS meter. Aimed at an easily usable/configured meter with efficient and accurate personal fight statistics, this standalone addon will allow you to see your DPS, percentage damage dealt, and total damage dealt for your current and previous fight.*

Within the settings window, you'll be able to access configuration options that will help you make the meter your own! You'll be able to change the coloring scheme for background and text as well as the window size and transparency. Furthermore, you can decide to autohide the meter, to show/hide your previous fight stats, and the behavior for current fight stats. Lastly, you can select between 15 personal damage statistic formats, forming any combination of dps, total damage, and percent damage dealt!
